# Intrinsic_Dimension
Tools for testing  ID estimators against benchamrk data and a new estimator.
The code offered here is part of my Master's Thesis which has the estimation of the intrinsic dimension as its main topic. The benchmark framework synthetic data from https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2015/759567/
are generated using R since it was too hard to find all the data gathered otherwise.
